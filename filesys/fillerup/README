Some testing results:

 * OpenBSD 5.2 shows 105% full and -89632 Avail after the root reserved
   space is run through. (Otherwise "0" and 100%.)
 * A Mac OS X disk image (extended filesystem) offers no root
   reserved space.
 * An old RedHat Linux 7.3 virt shows 100% full, even after the root
   reserved space is run int. (And "0" Avail.)

Other things to test:

 * Sparse files and how various things view how much space those use
   (mess around with lseek(2) calls).
 * rm the file being written to and find what various utilities can show
   the unlinked but as-yet active inode.
