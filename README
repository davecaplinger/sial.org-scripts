again, should not be used, except as a warning to the next ten generations.

Things may well be moved or deleted without notice. If this is a
concern, copy the bits somewhere else. Or back away, slowly.

A Historical Missive
--------------------

This ragged bundle of bits began as a CVS repository, not less than a
few years ago. At one point, it was briefly migrated to Subversion, but
that ended in disaster when the Subversion database wedged--something
about BDB and Mac OS X, who knows. One can find traces of this event in
the history. Anyways, it was back to CVS for a while longer, until
eventually I moved to git, that being the fashionable thing for Perl
folks to do, or so I hear. git has yet to blow up on me, which I
suppose is nice.
